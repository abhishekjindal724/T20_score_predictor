# T20_score_predictor
This project is centered around developing a robust machine learning model to predict the scores of T20 cricket matches. Given the fast-paced and dynamic nature of T20 cricket, accurately predicting the scores is a complex task that involves analyzing a variety of factors, including player performance, pitch conditions, weather, and historical match data.
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the final scores of a team batting first in a T20 match. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide accurate predictions that can assist in strategic decision-making for teams, coaches, and analysts.
